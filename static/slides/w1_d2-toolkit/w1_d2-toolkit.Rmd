## So far this week...

- Hands on practice with R, RStudio, Git, GitHub
- First look at visualising and summarising data in R
- Why summary statistics alone are not sufficient for data exploration
- Clarifications requested:
  - One language: R
  - Teamwork: labs, project (assessed) + in class activities (suggested)
- And some of you still need to complete...
  - Syllabus review
  - Piazza sign up
  - Getting to know you survey

# R and RStudio

---

## R

- R can be used as a calculator.
```{r}
8738787213 / 1653
```


- The most commonly used data type in R is data frames, where each row represents 
an observation, and each column a variable.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

---

## R

- We use the `$` operator to access a variable within a data frame.

```{r}
mtcars$mpg
```

- Functions are (often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parantheses.

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

---

## R

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

---

## RStudio

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-anatomy.png")
```

---

## tidyverse

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
.center[
[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
]
- The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. 
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar.

# R Markdown

---

## R Markdown

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown-anatomy.png")
```

---

## R Markdown tips

- Keep the [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) and Markdown Quick Reference (Help -> Markdown Quick Reference) handy, we'll refer to it often as the course progresses
- The workspace of your R Markdown document is separate from the Console

---

## How will we use R Markdown?

- Every assignment / report / project / etc. is an R Markdown document
- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with
- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester
