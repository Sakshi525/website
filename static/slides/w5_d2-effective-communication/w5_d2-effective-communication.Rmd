# Simpson's paradox

## Berkeley admission data

- Study carried out by the graduate Division of the University of California, Berkeley in the early 70’s to evaluate whether there was a sex bias in graduate admissions.
- The data come from six departments. For confidentiality we'll call them A-F. 
- We have information on whether the applicant was male or female and whether they were admitted or rejected. 
- First, we will evaluate whether the percentage of males admitted is indeed higher than females, overall. Next, we will calculate the same percentage for each department.

---

## Data

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ucb_admit <- read_csv(here::here("csv/ucb-admit.csv"))
ucb_admit
```

---

## Skim the data

```{r message=FALSE}
library(skimr)
skim(ucb_admit) #<<
```

---

## Overall sex distribution

.question[
What can you say about the overall sex distribution? What type of visualization would be appropriate for representing these data?
]

```{r}
ucb_admit %>%
  count(sex, admit) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  mutate(prop_admit = n / sum(n))
```

---

## Overall sex distribution

```{r fig.height=2, fig.width=5}
ggplot(ucb_admit, mapping = aes(x = sex, fill = admit)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  labs(y = "", title = "Admit by sex")
```

---

## Sex distribution, by department

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=2.75}
ggplot(ucb_admit, mapping = aes(x = sex, fill = admit)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  facet_grid(. ~ dept) +
  labs(x = "Sex", y = "", fill = "Admission",
       title = "Admit by sex by department")
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=1.5, fig.width=7}
ggplot(ucb_admit, mapping = aes(x = sex, fill = admit)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "", y = "", fill = "", title = "Admissions by sex") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=7}
ggplot(ucb_admit, mapping = aes(x = sex, fill = admit)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  facet_wrap(. ~ dept) +
  labs(x = "", y = "", fill = "", title = "Admissions by sex and department") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)
```

# group_by

---

## What does `group_by()` do?

`group_by()` takes an existing `tbl` and converts it into a grouped `tbl` where operations are performed "by group":

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucb_admit
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>% 
  group_by(sex)
```
]

---

## What does `group_by()` not do?

`group_by()` does not sort the data, `arrange()` does:

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>% 
  group_by(sex)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>% 
  arrange(sex)
```
]

---

## What does `group_by()` not do?

`group_by()` does not create frequency tables, `count()` does:

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>% 
  group_by(sex)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>% 
  count(sex)
```
]

---

## Undo grouping with `ungroup()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>%
  count(sex, admit) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  mutate(prop_admit = n / sum(n)) %>%
  select(sex, prop_admit)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>%
  count(sex, admit) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  mutate(prop_admit = n / sum(n)) %>%
  select(sex, prop_admit) %>%
  ungroup()
```
]

# `count()`

---

## `count()` is a short-hand

`count()` is a short-hand for `group_by()` and then `summarise()` to count the number of observations in each group:

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>%
  count(sex)
```
]

---

## `count()` can take multiple arguments

.pull-left[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>%
  group_by(sex, admit) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>%
  count(sex, admit)
```
]

---

## `count()` vs. `group_by() %>% summarise()`

- `count()` ungroups after itself
- `summarise()` peels off one layer of grouping
- The question mark just means that the number of groups is unkown right now, it will only be computed when/if the next line is executed

.small[
.pull-left[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>%
  group_by(sex, admit) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ucb_admit %>%
  count(sex, admit)
  
```
]
]

# Communicating data science results effectively

---

# Five core activities of data analysis

1. Stating and refining the question
1. Exploring the data
1. Building formal statistical models
1. Interpreting the results
1. Communicating the results

# Stating and refining the question

---

# Six types of questions

1. **Descriptive:** summarize a characteristic of a set of data
1. **Exploratory:** analyze to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables (hypothesis generating)
1. **Inferential:** analyze patterns, trends, or relationships in representative data from a population
1. **Predictive:** make predictions for individuals or groups of individuals
1. **Causal:** whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population
1. **Mechanistic:** explore "how" as opposed to whether

# Ex: Viral illnesses

1. **Descriptive:** frequency of viral illnesses in a set of data collected from a group of individuals
--

1. **Exploratory:** examine relationships between a range of dietary factors and viral illnesses
--

1. **Inferential:** examine whether any relationship between dietary factors and viral illnesses found in the sample hold for the population at large

--
1. **Predictive:** what types of people will eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables during the next year

--
1. **Causal:** whether people who were randomly assigned to eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables or one that was low in fresh fruits and vegetables contract viral illnesses

--
1. **Mechanistic:** how a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables leads to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses

# Questions to data science problems

- Do you have appropriate data to answer your question?
- Do you have information on confounding variables?
- Was the data you're working with collected in a way that introduces bias?

.question[
Suppose I want to estimate the average number of children in households in 
Edinburgh. I conduct a survey at an elementary school in Edinburgh and ask 
students at this elementary school how many children, including themselves, 
live in their house. Then, I take the average of the responses. Is this a 
biased or an unbiased estimate of the number of children in households in Edinburgh? 
If biased, will the value be an overestimate or underestimate?

## Checklist

- Formulate your question
- Read in your data
- Check the dimensions
- Look at the top and the bottom of your data
- Validate with at least one external data source
- Make a plot
- Try the easy solution first

---

## Formulate your question

- Consider scope:
  - Are air pollution levels higher on the east coast than on the west coast?
  - Are hourly ozone levels on average higher in New York City than they are in Los Angeles?
  - Do counties in the eastern United States have higher ozone levels than counties in the western United States?
- Most importantly: "Do I have the right data to answer this question?"

---

## Read in your data

- Place your data in a folder called `data`
- Read it into R with `read_csv()` or friends (`read_delim()`, `read_excel()`, etc.)

```{r echo=FALSE}
fav_food <- read_excel(here::here("csv", "favourite-food.xlsx"))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
fav_food <- read_excel("data/favourite-food.xlsx")
```

---

## `clean_names()`

If the variable names are malformatted, use `janitor::clean_names()`

.small[
```{r}
fav_food
```

```{r message=FALSE}
library(janitor)
fav_food %>% clean_names()  
```
]

## Case study: NYC Squirrels!

- The Squirrel Census (https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public. 
- This table contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.

```{r}
#install_github("mine-cetinkaya-rundel/nycsquirrels18")
library(nycsquirrels18)
```

## Locate the codebook

[mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/nycsquirrels18/reference/squirrels.html](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/nycsquirrels18/reference/squirrels.html)

<br><br>

--

## Check the dimensions

```{r}
dim(squirrels)
```

---

## Look at the top...

.small[
```{r}
squirrels %>% head()
```
]

---

## ...and the bottom

.small[
```{r}
squirrels %>% tail()
```
]

---

## Validate with at least one external data source

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
squirrels %>%
  select(long, lat) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/central-park-coords.png")
```
]

---

## Make a plot

.small[
```{r fig.retina=3, fig.height=2, fig.width=5}
ggplot(squirrels, aes(x = long, y = lat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```
]

--

**Hypothesis:** There will be a higher density of sightings on the perimeter 
than inside the park.

---

## Try the easy solution first

.small[
```{r fig.retina=3, fig.height=2, fig.width=5}
squirrels <- squirrels %>%
  separate(hectare, into = c("NS", "EW"), sep = 2, remove = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(where = if_else(NS %in% c("01", "42") | EW %in% c("A", "I"), "perimeter", "inside")) 

ggplot(squirrels, aes(x = long, y = lat, color = where)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```
]

---

## Then go deeper...

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.retina=3, fig.height=2.75, fig.width=5}
hectare_counts <- squirrels %>%
  group_by(hectare) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

hectare_centroids <- squirrels %>%
  group_by(hectare) %>%
  summarise(
    centroid_x = mean(long),
    centroid_y = mean(lat)
  )

squirrels %>%
  left_join(hectare_counts, by = "hectare") %>%
  left_join(hectare_centroids, by = "hectare") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = centroid_x, y = centroid_y, color = n)) +
  geom_hex()
```

---

```{r eval=FALSE}
hectare_counts <- squirrels %>%
  group_by(hectare) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) 

hectare_centroids <- squirrels %>%
  group_by(hectare) %>%
  summarise(
    centroid_x = mean(long),
    centroid_y = mean(lat)
  )

squirrels %>%
  left_join(hectare_counts, by = "hectare") %>%
  left_join(hectare_centroids, by = "hectare") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = centroid_x, y = centroid_y, color = n)) +
  geom_hex()
```

---

## The squirrel is staring at me!

.midi[
```{r}
squirrels %>%
  filter(str_detect(other_interactions, "star")) %>%
  select(shift, age, other_interactions)
```
]

---
