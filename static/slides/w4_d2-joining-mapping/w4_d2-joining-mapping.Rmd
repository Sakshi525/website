# Fisheries

---

Fisheries and Aquaculture Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
the United Nations collects data on fisheries production of countries. The (not-so-great) visualization belows shows the distribution of fishery harvest 
of countries for 2016, by capture and aquaculture.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/fisheries.png")
```

.footnote[
- Countries whose total harvest was less than 100,000 tons are not 
included in the visualization.
- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_industry_by_country
]

---

.question[
What are some ways your teams discussed/implemented for improving this visualization?
]

--

- Calculate summary statistics at the continent level and visualize them.
- Map the data.

---

## Data prep

```{r include=FALSE}
fisheries <- read_csv(here::here("csv/fisheries.csv"))
continents <- read_csv(here::here("csv/continents.csv"))
```

Filter out countries whose total harvest was less than 100,000 tons since they 
are not included in the visualization:

```{r}
fisheries <- fisheries %>%
  filter(total > 100000)

fisheries
```

# Data joins

---

.pull-left[
```{r}
fisheries %>% select(country)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
continents
```
]

---

## Joining data frames

```
*_join(x, y)
```

- `inner_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y, return 
all combination of multiple matches in the case of multiple matches
- `left_join()`: all rows from x
- `right_join()`: all rows from y
- `full_join()`: all rows from both x and y
- `semi_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.
- `anti_join()`: return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, never duplicate rows of x
- ...
 
---

## Setup

For the next few slides...

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- tibble(value = c(1, 2, 3))
```
```{r}
x
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
y <- tibble(value = c(1, 2, 4))
```
```{r}
y
```
]

---

## `inner_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
inner_join(x, y)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/inner-join.gif")
```
]

---

## `left_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
left_join(x, y)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/left-join.gif")
```
]

---

## `right_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
right_join(x, y)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/right-join.gif")
```
]

---

## `full_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
full_join(x, y)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/full-join.gif")
```
]

---

## `semi_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
semi_join(x, y)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/semi-join.gif")
```
]

---

## `anti_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
anti_join(x, y)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/anti-join.gif")
```
]

---

.question[
We want to keep all rows and columns from `fisheries` and add a column for 
corresponding continents. Which join function should we use?
]

.pull-left[
```{r}
fisheries %>% select(country)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
continents
```
]

---

## Join fisheries and continents 

```{r}
fisheries <- left_join(fisheries, continents) 
```

--

.question[
How does `left_join()` know to join the two data frames by `country`?
]

Hint:

```{r}
names(fisheries)
names(continents)
```

---

## Check the data

```{r}
fisheries %>%
  filter(is.na(continent))
```

---

## Implement fixes

```{r}
fisheries <- fisheries %>%
  mutate(continent = case_when(
    country == "Democratic Republic of the Congo" ~ "Asia",
    country == "Hong Kong"                        ~ "Asia",
    country == "Myanmar"                          ~ "Asia",
    TRUE                                          ~ continent
    )
  )
```

...and check again

```{r}
fisheries %>%
  filter(is.na(continent))
```

---

.question[
What does the following code do?
]

```{r results=FALSE}
fisheries_summary <- fisheries %>%
  mutate(aquaculture_perc = aquaculture / total) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(
    min_ap  = min(aquaculture_perc),
    mean_ap = mean(aquaculture_perc),
    max_ap  = max(aquaculture_perc)
  )
```

---

## Summarise by continent

```{r}
fisheries_summary %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_ap))
```

---

## Visualize continent summary stats

```{r fig.height=4,fig.width=10}
ggplot(fisheries_summary, aes(x = continent, y = mean_ap)) +
  geom_col()
```

---

## Improve visualization

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(fisheries_summary, 
       aes(x = reorder(continent, mean_ap), y = mean_ap)) + #<<
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) + #<<
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Average share of aquaculture by continent",
    subtitle = "out of total fisheries harvest, 2016",
    caption = "Source: bit.ly/2VrawTt"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() #<<
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(fisheries_summary, 
       aes(x = reorder(continent, mean_ap), y = mean_ap)) + #<<
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) + #<<
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Average share of aquaculture by continent",
    subtitle = "out of total fisheries harvest, 2016",
    caption = "Source: bit.ly/2VrawTt"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() #<<
```

---

## Improve visualization further

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(fisheries_summary, 
       aes(x = reorder(continent, mean_ap), y = mean_ap)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) + #<<
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Average share of aquaculture by continent",
    subtitle = "out of total fisheries harvest, 2016",
    caption = "Source: bit.ly/2VrawTt"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(fisheries_summary, 
       aes(x = reorder(continent, mean_ap), y = mean_ap)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) + #<<
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Average share of aquaculture by continent",
    subtitle = "out of total fisheries harvest, 2016",
    caption = "Source: bit.ly/2VrawTt"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Mapping

---

## Mapping the fisheries data

- Obtain country boundaries and store as a data frame
- Join the fisheries and country boundaries data frames
- Plot the country boundaries, and fill by fisheries harvest data

---

## `map_data()`

The `map_data()` function easily turns data from the maps package in to a data frame suitable for plotting with ggplot2:

```{r}
map_data("world")
```

---

# A few fixes for better matching

.question[
What does the following code do?
]

```{r}
world_map <- map_data("world") %>%
  mutate(region = case_when(
    region == "UK"           ~ "United Kingdom",
    region == "USA"          ~ "United States",
    subregion == "Hong Kong" ~ "Hong Kong",
    TRUE                     ~ region
    )
  )
```

---

## Map the world

.midi[
```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
ggplot(world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "gray") +
  theme_minimal()
```
]


---

## Join fisheries and world map

.pull-left[
```{r}
fisheries %>% select(country)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
world_map %>% select(region)
```
]

---

## Join fisheries and world map

```{r}
fisheries_map <- left_join(fisheries, world_map, 
                           by = c("country" = "region"))
```

```{r}
glimpse(fisheries_map)
```

---

## Mapping fisheries

.midi[
```{r fig.height=4.5, fig.width=12}
ggplot(fisheries_map, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = capture)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal()
```
]

---

.question[
What is misleading about the following map?
]

.midi[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=12, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(fisheries_map, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = capture)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal()
```
]

---

## Putting it altogether

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(world_map, 
               mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), 
               fill = "lightgray") + #<<

               mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, 
                             fill = capture)) + #<<
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
