# Coding style

---

## Style guide

>"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread."
>
>Hadley Wickham

- Style guide for this course is based on the Tidyverse style guide: http://style.tidyverse.org/
- There's more to it than what we'll cover today, but we'll mention more as we 
introduce more functionality, and do a recap later in the semester

---

## File names and code chunk labels

- Do not use spaces in file names and code chunk labels, use `-` or `_` to 
separate words
- Use all lowercase letters

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
ucb-admit.csv

# Bad
UCB Admit.csv
```

---

## Object names

- Use `_` to separate words in object names
- Use informative but short object names
- Do not reuse object names within an analysis

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
acs_employed

# Bad
acs.employed
acs2
acs_subset
acs_subsetted_for_males
```

---

## Spacing

- Put a space before and after all infix operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.), and when 
naming arguments in function calls
- Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English)

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

---

## ggplot2

- Always end a line with `+`
- Always indent the next line

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Bad
ggplot(diamonds,mapping=aes(x=price))+geom_histogram()
```

# Data wrangling and summarizing 
# with **dplyr**

## A grammar of data wrangling...

... based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames

.pull-left[
```{r dplyr-part-of-tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align = "center", caption = "dplyr is part of the tidyverse"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
.midi[
- `select`: pick columns by name
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `sample_n` / `sample_frac`: randomly sample rows
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `distinct`: filter for unique rows
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `summarise`: reduce variables to values
- `pull`: grab a column as a vector
- ... (many more)
]
]

---

## Rules of **dplyr** functions

- First argument is *always* a data frame
- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame
- Always return a data frame
- Don't modify in place

# Pipes

---

## What is a pipe?

In programming, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one process to another.

--

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `ncbikecrash`, and pass it to the `select()` function,
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% #<<
  select(county, bike_age) %>%
  arrange(bike_age)
```
]

.pull-left[
- Start with the data frame `ncbikecrash`, and pass it to the `select()` function,

]
.pull-right[

  select(county, bike_age) %>% #<<
  arrange(bike_age)
```
]

## Aside

The pipe operator is implemented in the package **magrittr**, though we don't need to load this package explicitly since **tidyverse** does this for us.

<br>

--

.question[
Any guesses as to why the package is called magrittr?
]

--

.pull-left[
```{r magritte, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", caption = "Magritte's pipe"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/magritte.jpg")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r magrittr, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", caption = "magrittr's pipe"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/magrittr.jpg")
```
]

---

## How does a pipe work?

- You can think about the following sequence of actions - find key, 
unlock car, start car, drive to school, park.
- Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:
```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "campus"))
```
- Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) 
structure:
```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "campus") %>%
  park()
```

---

## What about other arguments?

Use the dot to

- send results to a function argument other than first one or 
- use the previous result for multiple arguments

```{r fig.height=1.8, fig.width = 3.75}
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  lm(mass ~ height, data = .) #<<
```

---

## A note on piping and layering

- The `%>%` operator in **dplyr** functions is called the pipe operator. This means you "pipe" the output of the previous line of code as the first input of the next line of code.
- The `+` operator in **ggplot2** functions is used for "layering". This means you create the plot in layers, separated by `+`.
- Many of the styling principles are consistent across `%>%` and `+`:
  - always a space before
  - always a line break after (for pipelines with more than 2 lines)

# Data wrangling with dplyr

---

## `select` to keep variables

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(locality, speed_limit) #<<
```

---

## `select` to exclude variables

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(-object_id) #<<
```

---

## `select` a range of variables

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(city:locality) #<<
```

---

## `select` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(starts_with("bike_")) #<<
```

---

## `select` variables with certain characteristics

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(ends_with("age")) #<<
```

---

## Select helpers

- `starts_with()`: Starts with a prefix
- `ends_with()`: Ends with a suffix
- `contains()`: Contains a literal string
- `num_range()`: Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03
- `one_of()`: Matches variable names in a character vector
- `everything()`: Matches all variables
- `last_col()`: Select last variable, possibly with an offset
- `matches()`: Matches a regular expression (a sequence of symbols/characters expressing a string/pattern to be searched for within text)

.footnote[
See help for any of these functions for more info, e.g. `?everything`.
]

---

## `arrange` in ascending / descending order

.pull-left[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(ends_with("age")) %>%
  arrange(bike_age) #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  select(ends_with("age")) %>%
  arrange(desc(bike_age)) #<<
```
]

---

## `slice` for certain row numbers

First five

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice(1:5) #<<
```

---

## `slice` for certain row numbers

Last five
 
```{r}
last_row <- nrow(ncbikecrash)
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice((last_row - 4):last_row) #<<
```

---

## `sample_n` / `sample_frac` for a random sample

- `sample_n`: randomly sample 5 observations

```{r}
ncbikecrash_n5 <- ncbikecrash %>%
  sample_n(5, replace = FALSE) #<<
dim(ncbikecrash_n5)
```

--

- `sample_frac`: randomly sample 20% of observations

```{r}
ncbikecrash_perc20 <-ncbikecrash %>%
  sample_frac(0.2, replace = FALSE) #<<
dim(ncbikecrash_perc20)
```

---

## `filter` to select a subset of rows

Crashes in Durham County

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(county == "Durham") #<<
```

---

## `filter` for many conditions at once

Crashes in Durham County where biker is 0-5 years old

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter( #<<
    county == "Durham",     #<<
    bike_age_group == "0-5" #<<
    ) #<<
```

---

## Logical operators in R

operator    | definition                   || operator     | definition
------------|------------------------------||--------------|----------------
`<`         | less than                    ||`x`&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;`y`     | `x` OR `y` 
`<=`        |	less than or equal to        ||`is.na(x)`    | test if `x` is `NA`
`>`         | greater than                 ||`!is.na(x)`   | test if `x` is not `NA`
`>=`        |	greater than or equal to     ||`x %in% y`    | test if `x` is in `y`
`==`        |	exactly equal to             ||`!(x %in% y)` | test if `x` is not in `y`
`!=`        |	not equal to                 ||`!x`          | not `x`
`x & y`     | `x` AND `y`                  ||              |

.question[
Fill in the blanks for filtering for crashes **not** in Durham County where crash year is after 2014 and `bike_position` is not `NA`.
]

```{r eval=FALSE}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(
    county ____ "Durham", 
    crash_year ____ 2014,
    ____
    )
```

---

.question[
Fill in the blanks for filtering for crashes **not** in Durham County where crash year is after 2014 and `bike_position` is not `NA`.
]

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  filter(
    county != "Durham",   #<<
    crash_year > 2014,    #<<
    !is.na(bike_position) #<<
    )
```

---

## `distinct` to filter for unique rows

... and `arrange` to order alphabetically

.pull-left[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  distinct(county) %>% #<<
  arrange(county)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  select(county, city) %>% 
  distinct() %>% #<<
  arrange(county, city)
```
]

---

## `mutate` to create new variables

.midi[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  mutate( #<<
    crash_week = if_else(condition = crash_day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), #<<
                         true = "Weekend",  #<<
                         false = "Weekday") #<<
    ) %>% #<<
  select(crash_day, crash_week)
```
]

---

## "Save" when you `mutate`

Most often when you define a new variable with `mutate` you'll also want to save the resulting data frame, often by writing over the original data frame

.midi[
```{r}
ncbikecrash <- ncbikecrash %>% #<<
  mutate(
    crash_week = if_else(condition = crash_day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), 
                         true = "Weekend", 
                         false = "Weekday")
    )
```
]

---

## Check before you move on

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>% 
  distinct(crash_week, crash_day) %>% 
  arrange(crash_week)
```

---

.question[
What does the following code do?
]

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  mutate(crash_time_of_day = case_when(
    crash_hour > 5    & crash_hour <= 11 ~ "morning",
    crash_hour > 11   & crash_hour <= 17 ~ "afternoon",
    crash_hour > 17   & crash_hour <= 23 ~ "evening",
    crash_hour == 24  | crash_hour <= 6  ~ "night",
  )) %>%
  select(crash_hour, crash_time_of_day)
```

---

## `pull` to extract a column as a vector

.midi[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice(1:6) %>%
  pull(locality) #<<
```
]

--

vs.

.midi[
```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  slice(1:6) %>%
  select(locality)
```
]

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::knit_exit()
```

---

## `summarise` to reduce variables to values

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  summarise(avg_hr = mean(crash_hour))
```

---

## `group_by` to do calculations on groups

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  group_by(hit_run) %>%
  summarise(avg_hr = mean(crash_hour))
```

---

## `count` observations in groups

```{r}
ncbikecrash %>%
  count(driver_alcohol_drugs)
```
