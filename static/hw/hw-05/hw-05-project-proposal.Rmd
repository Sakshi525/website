This week you'll be working on your project proposal. The main difference of this homework from others is that you're working in [teams](https://github.com/ids-s1-19/team-assignments/blob/master/roster-team.csv) in a single team repo.

Instructions for what is expected for the full project, and specifically for the 
proposal can be found [here](https://introds.org/#project).

# RStudio Cloud

We will continue to use RStudio Cloud on this assignment. You can access the course RStudio Cloud workspace [here](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/34062). 

**Note:** You can also go to 
[rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) and log on. However it's important that 
then you navigate to the course workspace (it should be listed as IDS - Fall 2019) 
on the left menu. If you are in the correct workspace, your top bar should 
look like the following:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-cloud-workspace.png")
```

And if you are not, once you get started on your work you will see a message 
about packages you need not being installed. This should prompt you to navigate 
to the course workspace, and continue your work there.

Once you're in the workspace click on the Projects tab on top, and create a New 
project from Git Repo.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-cloud-new-project.png")
```

Then, copy and paste the URL of your repo, as you do each time. This will clone 
the repo and get you started with your assignment.

Finally, introduce yourself to Git once again (you will need to do this once 
per assignment on RStudio Cloud).
Run the following, with replacing `"Your Name"` with your real name and last name,
and `"your.email@address.com"` with the email address you used for GitHub.

```{r use-git, eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Your Name", 
               user.email = "your.email@address.com")
```
