Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate 
the course and the instructor anonymously. However, the use of these student 
evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is 
often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching 
related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. 

The article titled, "Beauty in the classroom: instructors’ pulchritude and putative 
pedagogical productivity" (Hamermesh and Parker, 2005) found that instructors 
who are viewed to be better looking receive higher instructional ratings.^[Daniel S. Hamermesh, Amy Parker, Beauty in the classroom: instructors pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity, Economics of Education Review, Volume 24, Issue 4, August 2005, Pages 369-376, ISSN 0272-7757, 10.1016/j.econedurev.2004.07.013. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775704001165.]

The data were gathered from end of semester student evaluations for a large 
sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, six 
students rated the professors’ physical appearance. (This is a slightly modified 
version of the original data set that was released as part of the replication 
data for Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models 
(Gelman and Hill, 2007).) The result is a data frame where each row contains 
a different course and columns represent variables about the courses and professors.

The variables in the data and their descriptions are as follows:

| Variable name    | Description 
|:--------|:-------------------------------
| `score` 		     | Average professor evaluation score: (1) very unsatisfactory - (5) excellent
| `rank` 		       | Rank of professor: teaching, tenure track, tenure
| `ethnicity` 	   | Ethnicity of professor: not minority, minority
| `gender` 		     | Gender of professor: female, male
| `language` 	     | Language of school where professor received education: english or non-english
| `age` 		       | Age of professor
| `cls_perc_eval`  | Percent of students in class who completed evaluation
| `cls_did_eval`   | Number of students in class who completed evaluation
| `cls_students`   | Total number of students in class
| `cls_level` 	   | Class level: lower, upper
| `cls_profs` 	   | Number of professors teaching sections in course in sample: single, multiple
| `cls_credits`    | Number of credits of class: one credit (lab, PE, etc.), multi credit
| `bty_f1lower`    | Beauty rating of professor from lower level female: (1) lowest - (10) highest
| `bty_f1upper`    | Beauty rating of professor from upper level female: (1) lowest - (10) highest
| `bty_f2upper`    | Beauty rating of professor from upper level female: (1) lowest - (10) highest
| `bty_m1lower`    | Beauty rating of professor from lower level male: (1) lowest - (10) highest
| `bty_m1upper`    | Beauty rating of professor from upper level male: (1) lowest - (10) highest
| `bty_m2upper`    | Beauty rating of professor from upper level male: (1) lowest - (10) highest

In this week's workshop you will analyze the data from this study in order to 
start exploring what goes into a positive professor evaluation.

# Getting started

## Clone your repo

```{marginfigure}
You can find your team assignment for the rest of the semester [here](https://github.com/ids-s1-19/team-assignments/blob/master/roster-team.csv).
```

Go to the course [GitHub organization](https://github.com/ids-s1-19) and locate 
your Lab 06 repo, which should be named `lab-07-model-course-evals-YOUR_TEAMNAME`. 
Grab the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio Cloud.

## Introduce yourself to Git

```{marginfigure}
Your email address is the address tied to your GitHub account and your name 
should be first and last name.
```

Run the following (but update it for your name and email!) in the Console to 
configure Git:

```{r git-config, eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Your Name", 
               user.email = "your.email@address.com")
``` 
  
## Download the data

In this lab you will first download the data, then upload it to the `data/` folder 
in your RStudio Cloud project.

```{r data-upload, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.width=3}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-upload.png")
```

- Click [here](https://introds.org/data/evals-mod.csv) to download the data. The file is called `evals-mod.csv`.
- Navigate to the data folder in your project and upload the `evals-mod.csv` file.

Then, you can load the data as usual using the following.

```{r data-show, eval=FALSE}
evals <- read_csv("data/evals-mod.csv")
```

## Load packages

We will use the following packages in this analysis:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
```



# Part 1: Data Manipulation 

1.  Create a new variable called `bty_avg` that is the average attractiveness
    score of the six students for each professor (`bty_f1lower` through 
    `bty_m2upper`). Add this new variable to the `evals` data frame. Do this in 
    one pipe, using the `rowMeans()` function within a `mutate()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
evals <- evals %>% 
  mutate(bty_avg = rowMeans(select(., bty_f1lower:bty_m2upper)))
```

Let's pause for a second to see what is happening in this piece of code. 
We are mutating the `evals` data frame by adding a new variable, `bty_avg`, 
that is calculated as the mean of the columns titled `bty_f1lower` through 
`bty_m2upper` in the `evals` data frame (denoted with a `.` here).

# Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

2.  Visualize the distribution of `score`. Is the distribution skewed? What does 
    that tell you about how students rate courses? Is this what you expected to 
    see? Why, or why not? Include any summary statistics and visualizations
    you use in your response.

3.  Visualize and describe the relationship between `score` and the new variable 
    you created, `bty_avg`.
    
```{marginfigure}
**Hint:** See the help page for the function at http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html.
```
    
4.  Replot the scatterplot from Exercise 3, but this time use `geom_jitter()`? 
    What does "jitter" mean? What was misleading about the initial scatterplot?

# Part 3: Linear regression with a numerical predictor

```{marginfigure}
Linear model is in the form $\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x$.
```

5.  Let's see if the apparent trend in the plot is something more than
    natural variation. Fit a linear model called `m_bty` to predict average
    professor evaluation `score` by average beauty rating (`bty_avg`). Based on the 
    regression output, which you can obtain with `tidy(m_bty)`, write the linear model.
    
6.  Replot your visualization from Exercise 3, and add the regression line to 
    this plot in orange color. Turn off the shading for the uncertainty of the line.
    
7.  Interpret the slope of the linear model in context of the data.

8.  Interpret the intercept of the linear model in context of the data. Comment 
    on whether or not the intercept makes sense in this context.

```{marginfigure}
Refer back to this week's reading if you don't remember what $R^2$ means.
```

9.  Determine the $R^2$ of the model and interpret it in context of the data. 
    You can obtain this value with `glance(m_bty)`.

# Part 4: Linear regression with a categorical predictor

10. Fit a new linear model called `m_gen` to predict average professor evaluation `score` 
    based on `gender` of the professor. Based on the regression output, write the linear 
    model and interpret the slope and intercept in context of the data.
    
11. What is the equation of the line corresponding to male professors? What is it for 
    female professors?
    
12. Fit a new linear model called `m_rank` to predict average professor evaluation `score` 
    based on `rank` of the professor. Based on the regression output, write the linear 
    model and interpret the slopes and intercept in context of the data.
    
```{marginfigure}
Refer to the [forcats package](http://forcats.tidyverse.org/) for changing the order of levels.
```

13. Create a new variable called `rank_relevel` where `"tenure track"` is the baseline level. 

14. Fit a new linear model called `m_rank_relevel` to predict average professor evaluation 
    `score` based on `rank_relevel` of the professor. This is the new (releveled) variable 
    you created in Exercise 13. Based on the regression output, write the linear 
    model and interpret the slopes and intercept in context of the data. Also determine and 
    interpret the $R^2$ of the model.
