## Code of conduct

### Diversity & Inclusiveness

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official University of Edinburgh records, please let me know!
- Please let me know your preferred pronouns.
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your personal tutor is an excellent resource.
- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

### Academic integrity

The University takes academic misconduct very seriously and is committed to ensuring that so far as possible it is detected and dealt with appropriately. Find out more about the University's official policies around academic misconduct [here](https://teaching.maths.ed.ac.uk/main/content-to-be-reused/pgt-and-ug-reusable-content/academic-misconduct).

Cheating or plagiarising on assignments, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the University policies, and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved. Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade along with being reported to the School Academic Misconduct Office.

*A note on sharing / reusing code:* I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class. Except for the take home exams, you are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use of code from another team. On the take home exams all communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.

### Communication

I will regularly send course announcements via email and Learn, make sure to check one or the other of these daily. We will be using Piazza to facilitate course communication, particularly around questions and answers. If you have a question outside of class or office hours, first check if it has already been asked on Piazza and if not post there. If you have a question or concern you don't feel confortable posting of Piazza feel free to reach out via email.

### Professionalism

Please refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class.

## Course components

### Class

Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. Programming is a skill that is best learned by doing, so as much as possible you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each class. Attendance will not be be used to determine your mark but you are expected to attend all lectures and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and homework assignments.

### Teams 

For all of the team based assignments in this class you will be randomly assigned to teams of 3 or 4 students - these teams will change after each assignment. You will work in these teams during class and on the homework assignment. For team based assignments, all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment and you will be asked to evaluate your team members after each assignment is due. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team's overall mark.

Students are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as their central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member's relative contribution for each homework.

### Homework

Beyond the in class activities, you will be assigned weekly larger programming tasks throughout the semester. These assignments will be completed individually, and submitted as GitHub repositories. Homework with the lowest score for each student will be dropped.

### Labs

You will also complete weekly computing labs in teams during the Tuesday workshops. They are designed to be completed in class, and submitted as GitHub repositories. Lab with the lowest score for each student will be dropped.

### Project

You will be responsible for the completion of an open ended final project for this course, the goal of which is to tackle an "interesting" problem using the tools and techniques covered in this class. Additional details on the project will be provided as the course progresses. Each team's work will also be shared with and evaluated by at least one other team at an earlier stage in order to provide feedback in the form of code review. You must complete the final project and be in class to present it in order to pass this course.

### Online quizzes

These weekly multiple choice quizzes will help you evaluate your learning continuously. Online quiz with the lowest score for each student will be dropped.

### R tutorials

These weeklky R tutorials are designed to help with your learning. They are optional, and not graded. You can complete them individually, online.

## Grading

### Scheme

Your overall course grade will be comprised of the following components, and their weights:

- Homework: 50%
- Lab: 20%
- Project: 20%
- Quiz: 10%

### Moderation and scaling

Please review the official University and School policies  [here](https://teaching.maths.ed.ac.uk/main/undergraduate/studies/assessment/rules).

### Regrade requests 

Regrade requests must be made within one week of when the assignment is returned, and must be typed up, printed, and submitted in person to me. These will be honored if points were tallied incorrectly, or if you feel your answer is correct but it was marked wrong. No regrade will be made to alter the number of points deducted for a mistake. There will be no grade changes after the final project presentations.

### Late work policy

Please review the official University and School policies  [here](https://teaching.maths.ed.ac.uk/main/content-to-be-reused/pgt-and-ug-reusable-content/extensions). Late work will not be accepted for homework assignments, labs, and online quizzes. Only the work you have completed by the deadline will be marked for those assignments. The projects will follow the standard University late work penalty of 5% of the maximum obtainable mark per calendar day up to seven calendar days after the deadline. If you intend to submit work late for the project, you must notify the course organizer before the original deadline as well as as soon as the completed work is submitted on GitHub.
